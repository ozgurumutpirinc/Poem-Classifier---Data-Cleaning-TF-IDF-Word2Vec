This is my first NLP mini project on a poem dataset. 

Firstly text columns were cleaned by making it lowercase, removing special characters, numbers, too short words and stopwords. Then this data was tokenized.

Then TF-IDF and Word2Vec were applied that cleaned and tokenized data.

Finally, by using KMeans and PCA, data was seperated into clusters then visualized at the end.

This is not a big project and modeling that data will not give accurate results. However this mini project was a good practice for me to realize my text clenaing and vectorization skills which I am currently studyding on.
